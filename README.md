## **💡 Key Features:**
### **1. Data Collection**
- Users can input social media text manually.
- Supports bulk data import from **CSV files**.
- Timestamp-based logging of social media posts.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Cleans raw text data by **removing punctuation, emojis, and special characters**.
- **Tokenizes and normalizes** words to standardize analysis.
- Filters out **common stopwords** to improve trend accuracy.

### **3. Trend Analysis**
- **Extracts trending words** based on frequency.
- Filters out words **shorter than 3 characters** and common words.
- Identifies **popular hashtags and keywords** in the dataset.
- Generates a **sorted list of top trends**.

### **4. Sentiment Analysis**
- Categorizes posts into **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** sentiments.
- Uses **predefined keyword-based sentiment scoring**.
- Future extensions can include **ML-based sentiment classification**.

### **5. Data Visualization**
- Generates **Word Clouds** to represent trending words visually.
- Plots **Bar Graphs** showing the **top trending words and their counts**.
- Enables **interactive dashboard capabilities** (for future development).

### **6. Export and Report Generation**
- Saves analyzed results in **CSV format** for further use.
- Exports **processed social media posts** for record-keeping.
- Generates **trend analysis reports** for decision-making.

### **7. Scalability and Future Enhancements**
- Supports **real-time social media data streaming** (with API integration in the future).
- Can be extended with **machine learning models** for **predictive analytics**.
- Supports integration with multiple **social media platforms**.
